                                Although my original plan was to teach early primary, a Fourth Grade student teaching position in the Chicago Public School System changed my mind by allowing me to experience older students' curiosity and desire to learn. Since then, I've gain experience teaching Second, Third and Fourth Grades.

                                        <br>
                                        <em>Example:</em> When results of an exit slip showed students did not grasp the desired concept, instructional plans were adjusted. Using a different approach allowed students to learn the material, ensuring the method of instruction wasn’t what made the topic difficult.
                                    </li>

                                        <br>
                                        <em>Example:</em> When a quick check on a whiteboard revealed students didn’t understand the lesson’s objective, instead of moving on I adjusted and revisited the topic through another method.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Student Formative Self-Assessment</strong> to allow students to reflect on their own understanding of the lesson’s learning goal. (Master's Action-Based Research Project).
                                        <br>
                                        <em>Example:</em> Allowed students to think and write about their understanding of a math lesson, explain their strategies and reasoning to solve problems and their communication of a solution.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Standardized or Norm Tests</strong>, such as MAP testing or STAR testing, that use data to determine what needs to be a focus for instructional material.
                                        <br>
                                        <em>Example:</em> Using MAP data to identify areas of improvement for Math and ELA standards, I designed and implemented units to develop these skills. For example, a unit focused on text structure and genre improved students’ MAP scores, and use of a common formative assessment as a pre and post-test showed students had a greater understanding of structural elements of text genres.  
										<br>
										<em>Example:</em> Reviewed STAR math and reading scores to see areas of weakness and strength in these subjects, as well as to determine how to group students based on ability, and to adjust groups as student understanding changes. After administering STAR test multiple times throughout the year, data showed average student growth increased by a grade level.
